; The section describes various logging options for the Network API
; Debug Filename
;   The filename in which to store logging information
; Debug Filename2
;   When the size of "Debug Filename" reaches "Debug Filesize", it is copied
;   over "Debug Filename2" and the original log is cleared.
; Debug Filesize
;   The maximum size of the log file (in Kb)
; Debug IO Level
;   The paranoid level for Network API IO operations. A higher
;   value outputs more log entries.
;     0   = no logging
;     10  = errors only
;     100 = report all debuggin information
; Debug API Level
;   The paranoid level for Network API general operations

; Get Timeout Milliseconds
;   Number of milliseconds to wait for the server to respond (read only functions)
; Put Timeout Milliseconds
;   Number of milliseconds to wait for the server to respond (read / write functions)
; Retries
;   Number of retries the client will attempt when communicating with each server connection
; Server Port
;   The UDP port on the server with which to connect
; Flags
;   0x1 - Tells the server whether to strip strings from enums
; Client Ports
;   The client machine by default will use a system allocated port number in the range
;   1024...65000, due to the NetAPI using UDP packets some firewalls may block the
;   the return result from the server. In these cases specific rules are required in
;   the firewall to allow return traffic from the Server Port (50000 by default) to
;   the range of client ports. As the range 1024...65000 is quite large it may not 
;   be desirable at many sites to open such a large range. For these cases the range 
;   of ports used on the client machine can be adjusted by adding the following
;   entries to the services file in %systemroot%\system32\drivers\etc\:
;
;	hscnetapi_port_low      51101/udp                   #HSC NetAPI Client port low limit
;	hscnetapi_port_high     51120/udp                   #HSC NetAPI Client port high limit
;
;   This will then force the NetAPI client to use a port on the client end in the range 
;   51101...51120. It is advisable to provide a range of ports equal to the maximum number 
;   of NetAPI calls that may be made in parallel on the client machine, which is generally
;   the number of applications that utilise the NetAPI. The range of ports can be whatever
;   you like, however care should be taken to use a range that is not in use by other 
;   applications.
